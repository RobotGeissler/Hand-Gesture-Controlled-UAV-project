# _Sample project_

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This is the simplest buildable example. The example is used by command `idf.py create-project`
that copies the project to user specified path and set it's name. For more information follow the [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project)



## How to use example
We encourage the users to use the example as a template for the new projects.
A recommended way is to follow the instructions on a [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project).

## Example folder contents

The project **sample_project** contains one source file in C language [main.c](main/main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```
Additionally, the sample project contains Makefile and component.mk files, used for the legacy Make based build system. 
They are not used or needed when building with CMake and idf.py.

## Runtime instructions

This is reference for my personal VSCode environment on Ubuntu 20 LTS

Replaces `idf.py build` because default config does weird behavior with Ninja requirements:

In idf.py menuconfig

```
idf.py fullclean
```

```
Partition Table  --->
    (Custom partition table CSV) Partition Table Custom
```

```
Serial Flasher Config  --->
    Flash size (2 MB)  ---> (select a larger flash size)
```

```
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build
```

```
idf.py build
```

```
idf.py flash
```

```
blue is index and red is ring.
